Warm_Up_Q2:
1. What does the following logical expression evaluate to?
            (False or False) and (True and (not False)) 
since false or false is logically equivalent to false, and whatever the RHS evaluated to, false and something will finally equal to false
so this expression will equal to false

2. Let a and b be boolean variables. Is it possible to set values for a and b to have the following expression evaluate as False?
            b or (((not a) or (not a)) or (a or (not b)))
we can simply look at the slice b or (a or (not b))
if we want the final value is false, then both b and (a or (not b)) should evaluate to false
then b has to be false. not b will be true. and whatever the value of a is, the expression a or true will evaluate to true
then b or true will also be true. so we conclude that we cannot set values for a and b to have the expression evaluate as false
